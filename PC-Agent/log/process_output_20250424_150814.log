Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.

LLM Thought2: The user wants to find the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, and then create a spreadsheet in Excel with the company names and their stock prices. I have already searched for Nvidia's stock price. Now I need to extract the stock price, then search for Apple and Microsoft's stock prices, and finally create the Excel spreadsheet. First, I need to record Nvidia's stock price. Based on the screenshot, the current stock price of Nvidia is 106.43 USD. I will now search for Apple's stock price.

### Thought ###
The operation thought is to tap on a cell in Excel. The operation action is to tap on the element at coordinates (719, 506), which corresponds to "Ex cel" in the before screenshot. Since the after screenshot shows that Excel is open and a file is being used, it is likely that the tap on "Ex cel" was intended to open or interact with Excel. However, the after screenshot shows a dialog box indicating the file is locked. Therefore, the action did not directly lead to the intended outcome of creating a new spreadsheet.

Since the user's intention is to create a new spreadsheet in Excel, and the current action leads to a locked file dialog, it does not directly fulfill the user's intention.

The user intended to select cell A2 in Excel. The operation action was a tap at coordinates (13, 236). Before the operation, the text "1" is located at (13, 236), and after the operation, the text "1" is located at (13, 235). The text "A2" is located at (19, 182) after the operation. Therefore, the tap at (13, 236) selects cell A2 as intended.

Current Thought History:
  1: The user wants me to search for stock prices on Chrome, create a spreadsheet in Excel, and input the data. First, I need to open Chrome and search for the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft. Then, I need to open Excel and create a new spreadsheet. Finally, I need to input the company names and their corresponding stock prices into the spreadsheet.
  2: The user wants to search for stock prices and then create a spreadsheet. First, I need to search for the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft on Chrome. The search bar is at the top of the Chrome window.
  3: The user wants me to search for the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, and then create a spreadsheet in Excel with the company names and their corresponding stock prices. I have already opened Chrome and tapped the search bar. Now I need to type the search query for the stock price of Nvidia.
  4: The user wants to find the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, and then create a spreadsheet in Excel with the company names and their corresponding stock prices. I have already searched for Nvidia's stock price. Now I need to extract the stock price from the current page, then search for Apple and Microsoft's stock prices, and finally create the Excel spreadsheet. First, I need to record the Nvidia stock price. Based on the screenshot, the current Nvidia stock price is 106.43 USD. Then I need to search for Apple stock price.
  5: The user wants to search for the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, and then create a spreadsheet with the company names and their stock prices. I have already searched for Nvidia and Apple's stock prices. Now I need to search for Microsoft's stock price. After that, I will open Excel and create the spreadsheet.
  6: The user wants to create a new spreadsheet in Excel and write the company names and corresponding stock prices. First, I need to open the Excel application. Then, I will input the company names in column A and the stock prices in column B. I can find the stock prices of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft on the current screen.
  7: The user wants to create a new spreadsheet in Excel. The previous action attempted to interact with an existing Excel file, which was locked. To create a new spreadsheet, I need to find the option to create a new file within the Excel application. I should look for a "File" menu or a "New" option. Based on the screenshot information, there is a "�ļ�" (File) option at [28, 46]. I will tap on that.
  8: The user wants to create a new spreadsheet in Excel. Since the "File" menu is already open, I should tap the "New" option to create a new spreadsheet. Then I will type the company names and stock prices into the spreadsheet.
  9: The user wants to create a spreadsheet with company names in column A and stock prices in column B. I have already opened a new workbook in Excel. Now I need to type the company names "Nvidia", "Apple", and "Microsoft" into cells A1, A2, and A3 respectively. Then, I need to go back to Chrome, copy the stock prices for each company, and paste them into cells B1, B2, and B3 respectively.
  10: The user wants to create a new spreadsheet in Excel, write the company names in column A and the corresponding stock prices in column B. I have already opened Excel and created a new spreadsheet, and selected cell A1. Now I need to type the company names in column A and the corresponding stock prices in column B. First, I will type "Nvidia" in cell A1.
  11: The user wants to create a spreadsheet with company names and their stock prices. I have already typed "Nvidia" in cell A1. Now I need to move to cell A2, type "Apple", then move to cell A3 and type "Microsoft". After that, I need to move to cell B1, B2, and B3 to input the corresponding stock prices that I searched for in Chrome. First, I need to move to cell A2.

To create a new spreadsheet, I need to find the option to create a new file within the Excel application. I should look for a "File" menu or a "New" option. Based on the screenshot information, there is a "�ļ�" (File) option at [28, 46]. I will tap on that.

  9: The user wants to create a spreadsheet with company names in column A and stock prices in column B. I have already opened a new workbook in Excel.

Now I need to move to cell A2, type "Apple", then move to cell A3 and type "Microsoft". After that, I need to move to cell B1, B2, and B3 to input the corresponding stock prices that I searched for in Chrome. First, I need to move to cell A2.
