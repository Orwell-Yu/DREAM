### Thought ###
The user intended to open a blank workbook in Excel. The "Operation action" tapped on the "OfficePLUS" button at coordinate (900, 146). Based on the screenshot information before the operation, this button likely opens a template gallery or a similar feature within OfficePLUS. After the operation, the screenshot still shows the Excel interface, but the content has changed. It is likely that the "OfficePLUS" button opened a new workbook, but not necessarily a blank one. However, since the user's intention was to create a new spreadsheet, this action is a reasonable step towards achieving that goal.

The operation action is to type "Nvidia" at coordinate (56, 210). According to the screenshot information before the operation, the content at coordinate (56, 210) is "A". After the operation, the content at coordinate (56, 210) is "A". It seems that the typing action is performed at the correct location, but the content "Nvidia" is not fully displayed. This could be because the cell width is not enough to display the entire text. However, the action itself is correct in terms of typing in the specified cell.
