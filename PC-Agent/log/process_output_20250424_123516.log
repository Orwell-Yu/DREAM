Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.

Current Thought History:
  1: Okay, the user wants me to open a file named 'travel_plan2' in the 'Documents' folder using Notepad, then search for flight times from Beijing to three destinations in Chrome, and finally tell them which destination has the shortest flight time. First, I need to open the 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad. I'll start by opening the file explorer, navigating to the Documents folder, and then opening the file with Notepad.

Current Thought History:
  1: Okay, the user wants me to open a file named 'travel_plan2' in the 'Documents' folder using Notepad, then search for flight times from Beijing to three destinations in Chrome, and finally tell them which destination has the shortest flight time. First, I need to open the 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad. I'll start by opening the file explorer, navigating to the Documents folder, and then opening the file with Notepad. Since I don't see the file explorer or documents folder on the screen, I will try to open the Notepad app directly and then open the file from within the app.
  2: The user wants me to open the 'travel_plan2' file in 'Documents' in the Notepad app, check the three candidate destinations for the travel plan, search on Chrome for the flight time from Beijing to each destination, and tell me which candidate destination has the shortest flight time. I have already opened the Notepad app. Now I need to open the 'travel_plan2' file. Since I don't have direct access to the file system, I'll assume the 'Documents' folder is accessible through a standard file explorer interface. I'll start by trying to open the file explorer and then open the file. Since I don't have direct access to the file system, I will try to open the file using the "File -> Open" menu in Notepad.
  3: The user wants me to open the 'travel_plan2' file in 'Documents' in the Notepad app. I have already opened the Notepad app and the File menu. Now I need to open the file. I will double tap on the 'Open' option in the File menu.
  4: The user wants me to open the 'travel_plan2' file in 'Documents' in the Notepad app. I have already opened the Notepad app and the File menu, and the 'Open' dialog. Now I need to open the 'travel_plan2.txt' file. I will double tap on the 'travel_plan2.txt' file to open it.
  5: Okay, I have opened the 'travel_plan2.txt' file in Notepad. Now I need to extract the three candidate destinations from the file, which are Paris, France, Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo, Japan. Then, I need to search on Chrome for the flight time from Beijing to each destination and tell the user which destination has the shortest flight time.
  6: The user wants me to check the three candidate destinations for the travel plan from the 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad, search on Chrome for the flight time from Beijing to each destination, and tell me which candidate destination has the shortest flight time. I have already opened the 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad and opened the Chrome app. Now I need to read the three candidate destinations from the 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad. Then I need to search on Chrome for the flight time from Beijing to each destination, and tell the user which candidate destination has the shortest flight time. The 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad should be in the background. I need to switch to it and read the destinations. Then I need to switch back to Chrome and search for the flight times. I can see the Notepad icon in the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. I will tap on it to bring it to the front. Then I will read the destinations. Then I will tap on the Chrome icon to bring it to the front. Then I will search for the flight times. Finally, I will tell the user which destination has the shortest flight time.
  7: The user wants me to find the shortest flight time from Beijing to the three candidate destinations listed in the 'travel_plan2' file. I have already opened the file in Notepad and Chrome. Now I need to read the destinations from the Notepad file, search for flight times on Chrome, and then compare the flight times to determine the shortest one. First, I need to bring the Notepad app to the front.
  8: The user wants me to find the shortest flight time to one of the three destinations listed in the 'travel_plan2' file. I have already opened the file in Notepad and Chrome.

Current Thought History:
  1: Okay, the user wants me to open a file named 'travel_plan2' in the 'Documents' folder using Notepad, then search for flight times from Beijing to three destinations in Chrome, and finally tell them which destination has the shortest flight time. First, I need to open the 'travel_plan2' file in Notepad. I'll start by opening the file explorer, navigating to the Documents folder, and then opening the file with Notepad. Since I don't see the file explorer or documents folder on the screen, I will try to open the Notepad app directly and then open the file from within the app.
  2: The user wants me to open the 'travel_plan2' file in 'Documents' in the Notepad app, check the three candidate destinations for the travel plan, search on Chrome for the flight time from Beijing to each destination, and tell me which candidate destination has the shortest flight time. I have already opened the Notepad app. Now I need to open the 'travel_plan2' file. Since I don't have direct access to the file system, I'll assume the 'Documents' folder is accessible through a standard file explorer interface. I'll start by trying to open the file explorer and then open the file. Since I don't have direct access to the file system, I will try to open the file using the "File -> Open" menu in Notepad.
