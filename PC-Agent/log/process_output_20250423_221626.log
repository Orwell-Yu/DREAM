Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.

Current Thought History:
  1: The user wants me to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them using the Calculator app. First, I need to open Chrome and search for the dates. Then, I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the difference between the two dates.
  2: The user wants me to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them using the Calculator app. I have already opened the Chrome app. Now I need to type the search queries in the address bar and then open the Calculator app to calculate the interval.
  3: The user wants me to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. I have already searched for the date of International Labour Day in 2025. Now I need to search for the date of American Independence Day in 2025. Then I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the interval between the two dates.
  4: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for both dates in Chrome. Now I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the difference. International Labour Day is on May 1, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4, 2025.
  5: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for the dates of both days and opened the Calculator app. Now I need to input the dates into the calculator and calculate the difference. International Labour Day is on May 1, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4, 2025. So the interval is July 4 - May 1.
  6: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day (May 1, 2025) and American Independence Day (July 4, 2025). I have already opened the Calculator app and entered '5'. Now I need to continue inputting the numbers to calculate the difference between July 4th and May 1st. July is the 7th month and May is the 5th month, so the difference in months is 2. The number of days in May is 31, and the number of days in June is 30. So the number of days from May 1st to July 4th is 31 - 1 + 30 + 4 = 64. I need to input 64 into the calculator.
  7: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day (May 1, 2025) and American Independence Day (July 4, 2025). I have already opened the Calculator app. Now I need to calculate the number of days between May 1 and July 4. May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31 is 30 days. June has 30 days. From July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So the total number of days is 30 + 30 + 4 = 64. I have already input '56' into the calculator. Now I need to input '+' then '64' and then '=' to get the result.
  8: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day (May 1, 2025) and American Independence Day (July 4, 2025). I have already opened the Calculator app and entered '56+' into it, which is incorrect. I need to clear the calculator and then calculate the difference between July 4 and May 1. The number of days in May is 31, so from May 1 to May 31 is 30 days. The number of days in June is 30. So the total number of days is 30 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 64 days. I need to input 64 into the calculator.
