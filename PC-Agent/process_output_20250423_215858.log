Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.

Current Thought History:
  1: The user wants me to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. First, I need to open Chrome and search for the dates. Then, I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the interval.
  2: The user wants to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. The Chrome app is already open. I need to type the search query into the address bar.
  3: The user wants to find the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. I have already searched for International Labour Day 2025. Now I need to search for American Independence Day 2025. After that, I will open the Calculator app and calculate the difference between the two dates.
  4: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for the dates of both days in Chrome. Now I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the difference between the two dates.
  5: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 using the Calculator app. I have already opened the Calculator app in the previous step. Now I need to input the dates into the calculator and calculate the difference. International Labour Day is on May 1st, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4th, 2025. The interval is July 4th - May 1st. I will calculate the number of days from May 1st to July 4th. May has 31 days, June has 30 days. So the interval is 30 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 64 days. I will use the calculator to verify this.
  6: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for the dates and opened the Calculator app. Now I need to input the dates into the calculator and calculate the difference. International Labour Day is on May 1st, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4th, 2025. So the interval is July 4 - May 1 = 64 days. I will input 4, then subtract 1, then press the equals button.
  7: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. From the previous search results, International Labour Day is on May 1st, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4th, 2025. The current calculator display has the number 4. I need to input the date of American Independence Day (July 4th) and subtract the date of International Labour Day (May 1st). First, I need to input 7 (July) into the calculator.
  8: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already input '4' and '7' into the calculator, which means I have input '47'. Now I need to subtract this from the number of days between the two dates. Since International Labour Day is on May 1st and American Independence Day is on July 4th, the number of days between them is 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 65 days. So I need to input 65 - 47 into the calculator. First, I need to input the minus sign.
  9: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 using the Calculator app. I have already searched for the dates and opened the Calculator app, inputting "47-" into the calculator. Now I need to input "6" to represent July 4th, and then press the equals button to get the result.

Current Thought History:
  1: The user wants me to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. First, I need to open Chrome and search for the dates. Then, I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the interval.
  2: The user wants to search for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. The Chrome app is already open. I need to type the search query into the address bar.
  3: The user wants to find the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 and calculate the interval between them. I have already searched for International Labour Day 2025. Now I need to search for American Independence Day 2025. After that, I will open the Calculator app and calculate the difference between the two dates.
  4: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for the dates of both days in Chrome. Now I need to open the Calculator app and calculate the difference between the two dates.
  5: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 using the Calculator app. I have already opened the Calculator app in the previous step. Now I need to input the dates into the calculator and calculate the difference. International Labour Day is on May 1st, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4th, 2025. The interval is July 4th - May 1st. I will calculate the number of days from May 1st to July 4th. May has 31 days, June has 30 days. So the interval is 30 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 64 days. I will use the calculator to verify this.
  6: The user wants me to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for the dates and opened the Calculator app. Now I need to input the dates into the calculator and calculate the difference. International Labour Day is on May 1st, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4th, 2025. So the interval is July 4 - May 1 = 64 days. I will input 4, then subtract 1, then press the equals button.
  7: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. From the previous search results, International Labour Day is on May 1st, 2025, and American Independence Day is on July 4th, 2025. The current calculator display has the number 4. I need to input the date of American Independence Day (July 4th) and subtract the date of International Labour Day (May 1st). First, I need to input 7 (July) into the calculator.
  8: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already input '4' and '7' into the calculator, which means I have input '47'. Now I need to subtract this from the number of days between the two dates. Since International Labour Day is on May 1st and American Independence Day is on July 4th, the number of days between them is 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 65 days. So I need to input 65 - 47 into the calculator. First, I need to input the minus sign.
  9: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025 using the Calculator app. I have already searched for the dates and opened the Calculator app, inputting "47-" into the calculator. Now I need to input "6" to represent July 4th, and then press the equals button to get the result.
  10: The previous operations have successfully opened Chrome, searched for the dates of International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025, and opened the Calculator app. The calculator currently displays "47 - 6". The next step is to press the equals button to calculate the result. The equals button is located at coordinates (1146, 878).
  11: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already searched for the dates and opened the calculator. I have also input 47 - 6 into the calculator. Now I need to press the equals button to get the result.
  12: The user wants to calculate the interval between International Labour Day and American Independence Day in 2025. I have already opened the calculator and input 47 - 6 and pressed the equals button twice. The calculator should now display the result of the calculation. The final step is to read out the result.
