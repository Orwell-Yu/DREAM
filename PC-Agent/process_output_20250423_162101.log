Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.

The user wants to set an alarm based on an event in a memo file. The current operation involves tapping on a location in the "before" screenshot. Based on the coordinates [719, 348] and the surrounding text "document in Word, write downtl 1:ne abstract of the paper, and", it seems the agent is mistakenly interacting with a Word document instead of Notepad. This is likely a misinterpretation of the instruction. Therefore, the action is not what I would expect.
